# Visiting-SQL

I have been learning for past few days. SQL stands for Structured Query Language. It is one of the basic forms of structurally storing data in the Databases. There are lot of syntax and examples. Here are the parts that are in this repository:

### 1. Query:
    The Clauses & Statements shown in here are: DISTINCT, GROUP BY HAVING, ORDER BY, SELECT, TOP, DISTINCT, WHERE, etc.

### 2. DDL:
    DDL stands for Data Definition Language, mostly for Define how a table should be while creation. Shown Statements are: CREATE, ALTER, DROP.

### 3. DML:
    DML stands for Data Manipulation Language, it is used to run some mutation on the data after the table is created. You will find here: INSERT, DELETE, UPDATE, etc.

### 4. Conditions:
    Conditions in SQL are 5 types - Comparison, Logical, Range, Membership, Search. The WHERE clause plays a very important role in here. There is also AND, BETWEEN, LIKE, etc.

### 5. JOIN:
    There are two way for combining two tables - rowwise and columnwise. The rowwise combination (stacking data vertically) is known as SET and the columnwise combination (arranging data horizontally) is known as JOIN. And there are two types of JOINs - based on matching and unmatching conditions. The Basic JOINs Contains the matching data JOIN - NO JOIN, FULL JOIN, INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN. The Advanced JOINs contains the unmatching parts - FULL ANTI JOIN, LEFT ANTI JOIN, RIGHT ANTI JOIN, CROSS JOIN.

### 6. SET:
    The SET clause is for combining two tables rowwise. Here are: EXCEPT, INTERSECT, UNION, UNION ALL. UNION ALL is more time efficient than UNION.

### 7. FUNCTION:
    In SQL, there are functions of these types: Number, String, Date & Time and NULL. The corresponding Clauses are shown in this repo.

### 8. CASE:
    In SQL, CASE is just like the if in other languages, it handles the conditionals in here.
